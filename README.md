# Todo Application

This is a simple todo application built with React. It allows users to manage tasks and labels with features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks, and managing labels. The application stores data using local storage so that your tasks and labels persist even after a page reload.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a title, description, and label.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks' titles and descriptions.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Toggle Completion**: Mark tasks as complete or not complete with a button.
- **Manage Labels**: Add and edit labels used for categorizing tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (version 6 or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
   ```
````

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Components

### App Component (`App.js`)

Manages the main state of tasks and labels. It also handles saving tasks and labels to local storage.

### TaskForm Component (`index.js`)

Allows users to add new tasks. You can enter a title, description, and select a label. It has fields for task details and a submit button.

### TodoList Component (`index.js`)

Displays a list of tasks. If there are no tasks, it shows an image and a message indicating that no tasks are available.

### TodoItem Component (`index.js`)

Represents an individual task. Users can edit the task, toggle its completion status, or delete it. Editing mode allows changes to the task’s title and description.

### LabelManager Component (`index.js`)

Manages labels. Users can add new labels and edit existing ones. Labels are displayed as badges.

## CSS Styles

- **App.css**: Styles the main container of the application.
- **TaskForm.css**: Styles the task form inputs and buttons.
- **TodoList.css**: Styles the task list and empty state message.
- **TodoItem.css**: Styles each task item, including completion status and buttons.
- **LabelManager.css**: Styles the label management section and individual labels.

## How It Works

- **Task Management**: Use the form in `TaskForm` to add tasks. Tasks are displayed in `TodoList`, where you can edit or delete them.
- **Label Management**: In `LabelManager`, you can add new labels and edit existing ones. Labels are used to categorize tasks.
